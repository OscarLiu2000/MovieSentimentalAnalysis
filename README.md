"There's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy, and The Count of Monte Cristo ... 
never quite settles on either side."

The Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset is a corpus of movie reviews used for sentiment analysis, 
originally collected by Pang and Lee [1]. In their work on sentiment treebanks, Socher et al. [2] used Amazon's Mechanical Turk to create fine-grained labels for all parsed phrases in the corpus. This competition presents a chance to benchmark your sentiment-analysis ideas on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. You are asked to label phrases on a scale of five values: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive. Obstacles like sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity, and many others make this task very challenging.

There you will find have source code, a live demo, and even an online interface to help train the model.
